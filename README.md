# 📦 Demand Forecasting and Inventory Optimization for E-commerce

## 🧾 Project Overview

This project aims to build an **end-to-end demand forecasting and inventory optimization system** to support **small to medium e-commerce businesses**. By leveraging historical or simulated sales data, it enables accurate demand prediction, inventory control, and improved operational efficiency.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Predict future product demand using historical or simulated data.
- Optimize inventory levels to reduce **stockouts** and **overstocking**.
- Support decision-making with clear **visual dashboards**.
- Improve **supply chain planning** and **profitability**.

---

## 📊 Key Components

### 1. **Data Generation & Collection**
- Simulated sales data for multiple SKUs across categories (e.g., Accessories, Clothing, Electronics).
- Incorporates:
  - Seasonality (e.g., festivals, holidays)
  - Promotional effects
  - Random noise for realism

### 2. **Forecasting Models**
- Time series forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet, or machine learning-based models).
- Evaluated for accuracy and performance.

### 3. **Inventory Optimization Logic**
- Reorder point and EOQ (Economic Order Quantity) calculations.
- Safety stock and service level considerations.

### 4. **Dashboard & Reporting**
- Visualize key metrics such as:
  - Predicted vs actual demand
  - Inventory levels over time
  - Stockout and overstock alerts
- Built using tools like Tableau or Plotly Dash.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Prophet)
- **Jupyter Notebook** for development and analysis
- **Tableau** for visualization
- **Simulated Data** for input
